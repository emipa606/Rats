Rats will spawn to eat any unattended food or corpses that is not kept refrigerated.
Just like in real life!

Uses rats from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2113851330]FancyRats and https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2115080957]SnowRats if loaded.
More can be added via patches.
Will also spawn for meat from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2466790513]Rotten Meat

Works well with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2503519676]Some Like It Rotten for making a corpse-based rat-farm
