Rats will spawn to eat any unattended food or corpses that is not kept refrigerated.
Just like in real life!

Uses rats from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2113851330]FancyRats[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2115080957]SnowRats[/url] if loaded.
More can be added via patches.
Will also spawn for meat from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2466790513]Rotten Meat[/url]

Works well with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2503519676]Some Like It Rotten[/url] for making a corpse-based rat-farm
