Rats will spawn to eat any unattended food or corpses that is not kept refrigerated.
Just like in real life!

Uses rats from [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2113851330]FancyRats[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2115080957](SnowRats) if loaded.
More can be added via patches.
There is also mod-options for selecting other animals, if animals should spawn based on biome and if they should be able to spawn inside. Also options to limit to only corpses or non-corpses.
Will also spawn for meat from [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2466790513](Rotten Meat)

Works well with [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2503519676](Some Like It Rotten) for making a corpse-based rat-farm
A mod that can help with the rats is [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827497888](Cats Hunt For Fun)
