    <content>There is now an option to limit the amount of rats that can spawn on a map at the same time. This checks the total amount of rats already on the map if set and will not spawn more rats if the limit is reached.

    <content>There is now two new settings in the mod.
Firstly there is an option to only allow spawning of rats if they are defined in the biome definition. 
Secondly animals will no longer spawn inside unless defined in the settings.
Since for example a rat could spawn inside a house, a vulture should probably not.</content>
